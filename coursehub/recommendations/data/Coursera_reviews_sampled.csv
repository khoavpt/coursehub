"This was a pretty great first into to algorithms. Took me from essentially no formal experience to feeling pretty confident about where I go from here (CLRS, cracking the coding interview, etc). The only feedback I have for the instructors are: some of the lecturers don't have good english and it borders on impacting the comprehensibility of the course. Usually the subtitles fill in the gaps -- but in the latter half of the course these are often wrong as well. Fixing these would be a huge help!

"In total, I learned a lot in the course. The programming assignments are really hard but if you stick with it, it is very worth. One thing I didn't like that much are the explanation videos - here, the team could improve. A bit more informal ""intuition"" explanation would help a lot to create a better understanding of the material (e.g. like Prof. Ng in the Machine Learning course!).",Paul B,2019-05-29,4,algorithmic-toolbox,Algorithmic Toolbox

Overall this was a good course. Some of the presenters need to work on their presentation skills (personally I had no problems with the accents). I also felt that the sections on dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed and I needed to spend a bit of time researching this on third parties before I felt comfortable completing the exercises.The grading system was really cool and the exercises seemed well thought-out and thorough. I'd recommend this course to existing developers without a computer science background.

"A great course in its own right but it also fills a void between the ""Learn <programming language>"" and using programming languages to analyze Big Data. The instructors have put together an excellent introduction to the wonderful, and scary, world of algorithms. I must admit I was ready to send my PC flying through the window on numerous occasions when I could not get my particular implementation of an algorithm to run within the time AND memory limits set by the instructors. More so, because often you are not told what particular test case made it fail. In the end, I believe this is a great approach to have learners really dive into the material and think about the various run times before submitting a particular solution. Well worth while your time!",Michael B,2016-05-29,5,algorithmic-toolbox,Algorithmic Toolbox

Solid material.  Majority of the lectures are clear and are a nice logical progression.  I didn't have to resort to external materials apart from 1 problem.  I love that you're required to submit code that gets compiled & tested. It's a much better learning tool than just videos + multiple choice questions.  I'm looking forward to working through the other courses in this specialisation.,Jason G,2017-09-10,4,algorithmic-toolbox,Algorithmic Toolbox

"Relatively disappointing course. I was expecting more CLI examples and examples in the most recent version of the console. Lots of examples did not work out of the box and I had to muddle through settings of my own to fix them. I have a strong technical background and could find the appropriate settings; what about people who are really not interested in applications at all and just want to make their product cloud-native? Those people can be discouraged if they try to replicate an example on their own in a different tab and it doesn't work. Perhaps most worryingly, the entire specialization seems to not have any coding exercises. I fear that if I were to continue with this specialization, I would not get a full grasp of AWS services.

I would have liked more implementation and a bit more technical flavour. At the same time the technical infrastructure (Cloudera virtual Machine) needs to be updated. It is bit messy working on a machine with such a bad screen resolution. E.g.: Unfortunately, installing the guest additions affects the functionality of haddop on the virtual machine.

"Llevo algunos años como alumno en Coursera y este ha sido el curso de peor calidad que he encontrado. Estos son mis comentarios:1) Si bien me atrajo el tema por ser muy novedoso y porque llevo más de 3 años investigando y tomando cursos relacionados con Lean, no pude sentirme en un flujo en lo que se estaba entregando. Gracias los videos de la semana 5 pude encontrar por fín algo que me permitiera cerrar y conceptualizar.2) Si bien desde un principio un alumno puede notar que el desafío central está en la aplicación de Lean en la Construcción, me parece que no hay ejemplos muy concretos que me hayan dejado en claro cuáles son las mejoras y ventajas de su uso en ese mercado.3) Falta preparación de los relatores: Sé que en general los relatores leen sus cuando hacen videos en Coursera, pero en este caso sentía siempre que estaban leyendo la misma PPT que veía yo. Casi siempre explican el contenido parafraseando lo mismo pero con otras palabras. No hay ventajas comparado con Slideshare, por ejemplo. De repente algún relator(a) se enredaba, leía mal algunas palabras o dudaba de lo que estaba diciendo. Si  dejaban un link a cada PPT, quedaba más satisfecho.4) Presentación muy estática y poc novedosa. Es recomendable agregar animaciones, imágenes o dibujos más vivaces, entretenidos y que presenten mejor conceptos o abstracciones de lo que se está diciendo en vez de mostrar lo mismo que están leyendo los relatores.",Rodrigo M,2017-09-11,1,camino-excelencia-gestion-proyectos,Camino a la Excelencia en Gestión de Proyectos

"Very informational course and the pace is reasonably challenging. Knowledge learned in this course are super practical and can be directly applicable in many areas. The Keras curriculum is especially welcoming. Do take note that course 2 and TensorFlow are sort of hard requirements to be successful in this course. I did course 1 and this course together, and it turned to be not the best choice.Also, the risk of taking a new course is there were definitely several technical glitches which resulted in more troubleshooting than necessary. I believe this would be better with iterations. ",Sikang B,2017-12-04,4,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"Really nice course of convnets. I think the intuition behind them could be more explained. In my opinion, the artistic part of the this nets should not be in this course as there is plenty of more important knowledge to adquire.",Daniel A,2018-10-02,4,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"Good introductory course for ConvNet and its trending applications such as object detection and facial recognition. Materials are presented to give students more of an intuition and process to carry out ConvNet applications rather than a rigorous mathematical understanding. Basic TensorFlow knowledge is highly recommended or one may face difficulties or confusion during assignments. I personally would like the course materials to have more depth, so to really nail in every step in building a ConvNet application (since as of now the content can be surface-deep and easy to forget).",Yen-Chung T,2017-12-03,4,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"good courses, but it has some errors in the last assignment",Joseph L,2017-12-21,4,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"While the content of the course is thought provoking and up to date, the overall quality is quite low. Videos are of moderate quality with very poor audio editing, and the programming exercises suffer from poor auto-graders. Regarding programming assignments, I spend most of my time trying to get just right combination of function calls despite getting exaclty the right answer in my tests. Typically this comes down to using just right numpy or tensorflow function, despite either one giving the same results. Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking this course for credit but rather simply extracting the relevant lessons and recommended readings.",Robert D,2018-06-21,2,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"An exceptional course with a great deal of useful architectures and design ideas. Before this course, I had no idea what residual and inception networks are, however, the course gave me a relatively-deep look inside these networks. 1X1 convolution (network in network), convolutional implementation of sliding window and lots more are used efficiently. Face recognition and verification is one of the lovely topics that was covered.",Basel A,2018-08-25,4,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks

"Material explained very well, but course material was very poor.  To really understand the material one has to basically rewrite all the class notes themselves.  Maybe this is a great way to learn, but it can take a lot more time than advertised.  The jupyter notebooks are well done, and a great source for future reference.  But the main problem is that only the notebooks can be downloaded.  All datasets and pictures do not download using the provided coursera instructions.  I called coursera, but the problem could not be solved.  This was very disappointing and extremely frustrating.",Andrew W,2019-12-16,2,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
Great course!,Thomas W,2018-06-04,4,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"While I enjoyed Andrew's course on NN, I am a bit disappointed with his CNN section for one major reason: he did not explain the philosophy behind filters, etc. Instead, he tried to cover too many things based on the latest developments in the field of CNNs. Take this course if you don't mind being exposed to the subject without understanding deeply (no pun intended!).",Navid A,2020-08-27,2,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
Some of the topics were not explained in enough detail and felt like being quickly skipped. There were some problems with the grader system in one of the assignments which wasted a lot of time and caused frustration. ,Stoyan S,2018-07-29,2,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"The content of the course is very good, as with all the Andrew Ng / deeplearning.ai material. However production standards seem to have slipped for this one. Repeated sections in video material and a final notebook exercise that contained errors and required finding a work around that was posted in a discussion forum. I hope these things can be corrected for others.",Stephen W,2017-12-08,3,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"Frustrating and annoying pitfalls in the assignements: most of the time you lose time on trivial syntactical issues on python / tensor flow, rather than concentrating on the model itself.Beside that the Kernel stabiliyt is gettin worse and worse in these courses as the weight of the models increase: the kernel breaks too frequently and you don't have  any other way to restart it from the beginning, losing all the modification. It takes ages to reach the end for trivial issues, not related to the subject of the course It is impossible to accomplish the grades without digging in the forums",Stefano A,2018-06-05,2,convolutional-neural-networks,Convolutional Neural Networks
"Excellent content but platform was frustrating at times. The exercises still use TensorFlow 1.2.1, which created some aggravation because newer versions have rearranged many functions into tf.math.xxx, etc., so the documentation ""hints"" give answers that don't match what is needed for the exercises. Also, the grader is maddeningly finicky, giving no points for code that is in fact correct. It's like playing ""Simon Says"".  It seems that a decent chunk of the required effort consists of scouring through the discussion forums for workarounds to these glitches.

I encountered a few issues in the autograder and test data loading.  I burned some time tracking down them.  Fortunately my fellow classmates were very helpful in the forum.  I am sure all problems would be solved in coming weeks.  Just keep a mental notes.Having said that, the materials is worth the pain.

This is documented in the discussion centre going back a couple of years, mentors help explain, but mentors cannot edit to fix the code, and the course supervisors have long since disappeared.

The videos need editing. Ng repeats himself in several places as he tries to explain an idea. The programming assignments use too many global variables.

"While the content is extremely relevant, it offers virtually no theoretical base or context. Those are actually in the Machine Learning With Python course. Reason why I emphatically suggest the staff to change the course order and place this one as the 8th course in the IBM Professional Certification, right after the Machine Learning one. As somebody who is about to finish the whole series, I can say with property that the current order doesn't make sense and, for that, has a negative impact on our (students) understanding, motivation, learning and development.

Worse yet, you are required to work in BlueJ, (google it) with custom Javascript functions that you are not allowed to view or use outside the course. So, none of the code you write in this course will ever be able to be used anywhere else. (The functions probably are in a minified file, but the students were not given access to that file.)

I'm glad I stuck with it though because I believe that I was able to get far enough in my understanding to pass this course and also give me an idea of some things I may like to explore in the future.

I'm glad I stuck with it though because I believe that I was able to get far enough in my understanding to pass this course and also give me an idea of some things I may like to explore in the future.

"I found this an interesting course. I've been a language student myself for a number of years and very much this has taught me that knowing how to speak English and knowing how to teach English are two very different things. This has been a great ""taster"" to see whether teaching English to speakers of other languages could be something I am interested in pursuing professionally. I was initially a little scared regarding the peer review assignments, however I think this is a valuable way to consider aspects of an issue that I did not consider myself. Lastly, I also wonder if this course will help me become a better student myself - a definite unexpected benefit!",John B,2020-09-05,5,english-principles,Teach English Now! Foundational Principles

"Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses. The peer assessments are potentially interesting but, in practice, the majority are so trivial--3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures--as to be hardly worth reading. Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading, the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted.The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others. . .  not. I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I'm a boring old sod!",Paul J M,2016-03-14,4,english-principles,Teach English Now!

"A great start for anyone dreaming about becoming a certified English teacher. Basic principles laconically explained in high-quality videos by a very charismatic professional. Interesting and enlightening concepts helping to look at teaching from a different angle and enrich your own process of doing the job. Unfortunately, there are disadvantages to this too. For anybody whose English is C1 and higher this course will be a little undemanding. Weeks in the course consist of only several short videos and text lectures. But, as I have put it, this course is for beginners and, mostly, for foreigners whose goal is to teach English abroad and get a certificate as fast as possible. Another thing, probably the most crucial for me is lack of feedback from professional teachers regarding evaluation of essays. Your work is evaluated by your peers the majority of which are, firstly, not so well versed in English, making myriads of mistakes along the way without a second thought to correcting them, and, secondly, do not really care about the amount of work you put into your essays. It was quite common to see dry, simplistic ""Good."" comments without any proper critique. This, of course, does not encompass each and everybody enrolled to this course and has nothing to do with the very course itself, but this is the picture I dealt with most of the time having my essays reviewed. Anyways, the course is worthwhile and will definitely help you.",Eugene P,2020-04-16,4,english-principles,Teach English Now! Foundational Principles

Great structure that builds upon the previous weeks knowledge  and also contains detailed examples with enough data content that allows you to 'play' around and practice.  It delivers on it's essentials tagline, as the topics are relevant and focused to provide a great base to 'overcome' any fears of using Excel, so that you can build upon good knowledge in the workplace.From start to finish one of the best online courses that i've ever seen and participated in.",Chris B,2020-05-07,5,excel-essentials,Excel Skills for Business: Essentials

"This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",James R,2019-04-23,1,financial-markets-global,Financial Markets

Creo que es un poco general y abandona mucho a las personas a la hora de realizar su presupuesto personal. Considero que podría ser un poco mejor si dividen el presupuesto en 2 sesiones donde quede mas claro que es variable que es fijo y sobre todo la forma en la cual deben manejar sus gastos (que pasa si se están pasando?). Adicionalmente creo que es importante realizar una sesión de experiencias o de ejemplos para demostrar que se puede conseguir con el presupuesto familiar (algo así como casos de éxito que siempre sirven para motivar a las personas).

"The overall setup and information in the course is helpful and builds a foundational knowledge of working with shapes and color. There is not a very strong concept of what makes a pleasing image, and the example images and designs are relatively cheap and childish. This leads to students doing quick, unpolished work.

"Recommended even if you have some experience with Unity. I have a Computer Science degree and worked as a professional game developer on released iOS and Android Unity games, and even though the material was a breeze, I still learned from it. Fits the description as a good introduction. The code week kind of throws beginners into the deep end a bit (lots of material just sort of thrown at you, but they warn you about the ramp up requirements).

"While I enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand, I was disappointed in how little coding we did. The code walkthroughs were rushed and I barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the scripts we used in the basic projects. Since scripting is such a huge part of game development, I feel like there should have been more focus on it. Maybe a new term in each video or something?And I understand that the course was only four weeks, which doesn't allow much time for deep scripting analysis, but maybe the course should be longer than four weeks.Overall a fun class and I now have two games to show off to people.",Christopher J,2015-12-28,3,game-development,Introduction to Game Development

I was not a complete beginner going in, but with the course taking me back to real basics, I found it helped fill in a lot of blanks that I didn't even know I had. Even if the rest of the course from week 3 turns out to not be as good, I will still feel I got a tremendous amount out of this!

"the course was a very good way to start in unity and to be good with it's UI and other stuff like particles , animation ,camera , creating objects and this stuff but it's not good if you want programing and coding the course did not go in details in coding it's just scratch  the surface of coding if you understand what i mean and this  made me annoying and disappointed in the end of the course ",Mohamed H,2019-09-02,4,game-development,Introduction to Game Development
"This course is wonderful, fast paced and engaging.  The assignments are fun and make you feel like you are progressing.  Maybe one challenge is that Unity is evolving very quickly and some of the material refers to deprecated Unity features.  But as of Unity 5.6, you should still be able to get through the course with only minor tweaks.  Having to search for solutions is something you'll need to do when you're working on Unity projects by yourself, so might as well get used to it.

"I loved it. I learned a ton about making games and I learned it by doing it. So, I have two games and a media simulation to show for it. Unity was covered. However, 3D modelling, illustration, and audio were not really taught (but a little bit, in theory.) I think it somewhat has to be like this, unfortunately. For me, I used Blender, Photoshop, and Fruity Loops to create my assets, but mostly just the game development is handled in this course. I'm only saying this, because you should know this upfront, really, which I didn't.Looking forward to the next class...",Jason M,2015-10-12,5,game-development,Introduction to Game Development

"This is a very introductory course meant for people having absolutely no background in 3D graphics or 3D game development. As a student with some experience in OpenGL and concepts like 3D transformation algorithms and whatnot, I believe that the course clearly delves into the making of the games rather than having deep insight into the algorithms required for that which is absolutely amazing and easy to understand for a starter. However if the course takers are expecting a deep insight into the 3D world and the mathematics behind that, you'll have to rely on other sources like books on Computer Graphics. However as an introductory course this clears the required concepts to a required extent. ",Rahul S,2016-07-12,4,game-development,Introduction to Game Development

I have a Computer Science degree and worked as a professional game developer on released iOS and Android Unity games, and even though the material was a breeze, I still learned from it. Fits the description as a good introduction. The code week kind of throws beginners into the deep end a bit (lots of material just sort of thrown at you, but they warn you about the ramp up requirements).

A very useful basic course on the process of making a game and using Unity. The lessons are well structured and give an excellent overview of everything that is involved with creating a videogame, though never going into the detail (it's not a programming or 3D modeling course). The quality of the lessons is the best I've experienced here so far and the videos are very comprehensible to a non-native english speaker because of the clear speech. I loved the fast pace, but I guess it could be a problem if you're not used to it.  ",Elena M,2016-11-18,5,game-development,Introduction to Game Development

I think it would be even better if there was a task to create a simple notebook from scratch - that is something that I will need to do to continue learning.,Peter B,2019-01-20,5,gcp-big-data-ml-fundamentals,Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals

First of all, with all due respect for the trainer, he used a flat voice tone that is challenging you to stay awake.  Secondly, I think more details and real-life examples would've been useful.I liked the labs and the platform, I think this was the most useful part of the course.One last mention, I don't if this is a Coursera feature or the course itself, but the progress tracking could be improved in my opinion.

"The information in the course was great, the expertise by the instructors was very good.  The labs were good also.  What was really jarring was the amount of short (less than 60 seconds to 2 minutes) videos.  You watch something for 20 seconds, then there's a 10 second pause for the next one queues up, then it buffers and starts.  This process takes almost as long as at the videos.  If they merged some of those together, the course would flow much more smoothly and be a lot more enjoyable.  Also the first course in the specialization had us set up a private free-tier on GCP. This one used qwiklabs.  The free tier is faster and easier to use. But the qwiklabs is a really nice feature.  I just wish the specialization would pick one or the other.",Stephen H,2018-02-07,2,gcp-infrastructure-foundation,Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation

Not comprehensive at all. The video are oddly chopped up and I feel like there is so much more to be taught. If this is Google's way of training their product then I'm out and will go the AWS route. In my opinion this is horrible training. I'll be afraid to use this training as study material for their certification. Google really need to get a team and work on this the right way.

What was really jarring was the amount of short (less than 60 seconds to 2 minutes) videos.  You watch something for 20 seconds, then there's a 10 second pause for the next one queues up, then it buffers and starts.  This process takes almost as long as at the videos.  If they merged some of those together, the course would flow much more smoothly and be a lot more enjoyable.  Also the first course in the specialization had us set up a private free-tier on GCP. This one used qwiklabs.  The free tier is faster and easier to use. But the qwiklabs is a really nice feature.  I just wish the specialization would pick one or the other.",Stephen H,2018-02-07,2,gcp-infrastructure-foundation,Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation

"Overall I learned a lot. The course covered the topic of HTML 5 and the concepts behind the internet (hosting, protocols, DNS, etc.)I like that it was purely quiz/project based and no grading was done as peer review. However, occasionally (about 1/20) some of the quiz problems were just plain wrong. Also, the final project was a bit too strict and needed more fuzzy logic for the parser. One could produce visually identical and 100% valid results and still not get a perfect score. That seems a bit flawed to me. However, if you really want to labor on it, you can just give the quiz what it wants and eventually get a full score.All-in-all, I would recommend the course.",Jason M,2015-12-13,4,html,Introduction to HTML5

"The course is quite thorough for a basic course and is challenging in pace. The work load is higher than the guidelines suggest for someone who hasn't done any programming for a while and is not familiar with object-oriented programming Yaakov is very knowledgeable and presents the material in an accessible way. He throws in some humor, which helps with absorbing the material. The quizzes are good learning guides and are appropriate for the material in the course. They require some thought, but adhere to the topics in the course without assuming additional knowledge. The exercises are difficult and take more time than the listings. But the reference materials are helpful and the online forums are very useful in clarifying points of uncertainty. I found some of the assignment descriptions, especially in modules four and five, to be unclear and it took some additional research to understand the intent of the task.The registration process and installation of the needed software was clearly explained and easy to accomplish. The software worked well with the course and enhanced the learning experience. I especially liked the way BrowserSync worked with Sublime Text and Chrome. The Chrome analysis tools are very useful. The use of Github as a coordinating platform worked well, for submitting assignments. The Coursera UI was very efficient at tracking progress and coordinating the peer level reviewing.Overall, I enjoyed the course and found it well worth the effort despite the few frustrating hours that always accompany grasping new skills.",Charles R,2017-02-04,5,html-css-javascript-for-web-developers,"HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers"

I can suggest to add more practical interactive exercise and also in the explanation of the steps during the setting part of the software, please add a list with all the steps to follow. I really had an hard time there.Despite this, the course is amazing and it was a pleasure to learn more about this fascinating word.

"I appreciated the material and how it was delivered. It could have had more examples from the east coast.  The presenters were all well-spoken and knowledgeable on the topics that they were delivering.  I especially liked the cameo appearances of Professor Tall Bear and her brief lectures on Genetics and Indigenous Feminism.  I believe that a lot of time and effort were put into the lessons, but I think more focus is needed on some of the quiz questions.  Assessments should consist of the main ideas the lecturer is focused on and what they want the students to take away from the lesson; not something that is not significant or barely mentioned.  It was difficult to decide on what notes to take, as the lecturer could have spent a significant time discussing a subtopic and there was nothing on the quiz about that subtopic.  As an educator, I would probably use about 50% of the questions.  Also, there were “glitches” with the technology, as several times the quiz would “freeze” and when I tried to click the screen would eventually work but the click would change an answer (depending on where I had the mouse) or submit it when I was not finished.  This happened 3-4 times.  Thankfully, we could try again.  ",Lisa R,2020-08-15,4,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada
This is the history and social studies class we all should have had in school!  My thanks to the instructors for filling in these deeply regretted blind spots in our education.

Amazing course. As a Non-Indigenous person with only a vague understanding of Indigenous Peoples history this really open my eyes to both the past and present of Indigenous Peoples. I truly believe this course should be made a mandatory component of the high school curriculum across Canada. ,Sarah H,2020-07-09,5,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada
Content was really great! My only complaint were the quizzes. I took a couple twice and some correct answers were counted as wrong. It doesn't change my takeaway that the course itself was really good and made me want to learn more in different Indigenous studies classes going forward. It obviously can't cover everything in depth but definitely helps to fill in holes where most provincial primary and secondary education curriculums fail. ,Anna L,2020-08-23,4,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada
Very pleased with the content of this course. ,Karen M,2020-09-13,5,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada
I have thoroughly enjoyed learning and analyzing my self awareness on each of the modules.  The course was able to connect the dots in my understanding of my own culture. I learned a great deal of information with regard to treaties and governance and even the Indian Act.  I learned the history when a child but I enjoyed it much better from an indigenous perspective.  I am grateful also to better know what our ancestors lived through to better understand Intergenerational trauma.  I will continue to seek a greater way of being.

"As someone who grew up, denied of his heritage and culture. I am grateful for this course, it's knowledge, understanding and inspiration. The lesson on art and it's ability to raise awareness, understanding, while inspiring, touched my soul and encouraged me even more to continue with my public art sculpture, The Missing Rose. The Missing Rose, funded through the Original Peoples Investment Program by Calgary Arts Development and the City of Calgary. Is a contemporary metal sculpture of 11 enlarged polished steel roses, set in a broken heart shaped vase, centered on a Medicine Wheel base. 11 Roses as one is missing to honor and commemorate our lost sisters. This project is focused on raising awareness and donations, while honoring and commemorating the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls of Canada.

I found the course very informative and enjoyable. Content that every Canadian should know!,Lisa M,2020-07-07,4,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada
I found the course very interesting and thought-provoking. Why didn't we learn this stuff in school?! I particularly found the topics of residential schools and gender interesting and will be learning more about the Indigenous POV on these in the future. I also loved that it ended with a module on Indigenous art and artists. I did not know of Christie Belcourt and Rebecca Belmore before this and my curiosity to seek out more about them is piqued. I appreciated that there weren't papers to write. Thank you very much! Will look forward to any tangential courses from the Native Studies dept. from the U of A in the future!,Michelle B,2020-09-28,4,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada
This introductory course had three main presenters who were great at telling the stories. I liked Dr. Tracy Bear the most as her style and tone was very conducive to my learning. This course is heavily geared toward watching videos and clips of others talking about specific items. There is also an art and artist component. It is not difficult to follow and read the notes. I would like more reference to maps and locations of some of the native groups as there were only generalities and green dots on a map of Canada.

"From a white man looking into a foreign culture, it was very interesting to see the uniqueness and beauty of the Indigenous culture brings.  The content of this course was exactly what I was hoping for.  Some criticism: I hate trick questions and I strongly believe that they should be left out of testing.  Additionally, some of the material was presented in a very dry and monotonal way.  I would have liked to see more enthusiasm and excitement when someone is talking about their roots.

My only criticism is that some of the lecture reading materials seem to not have been proof-read and edited for errors.  Found several sentences that were missing words, and some that didn't make sense at all, particularly in the Week 12 reading materials.

Some of the quizzes felt as if they were trying to trick you with the options. I felt the tests could have asked better questions that were designed to teach rather than push memorization.

"I appreciated the material and how it was delivered. It could have had more examples from the east coast.  The presenters were all well-spoken and knowledgeable on the topics that they were delivering.  I especially liked the cameo appearances of Professor Tall Bear and her brief lectures on Genetics and Indigenous Feminism.  I believe that a lot of time and effort were put into the lessons, but I think more focus is needed on some of the quiz questions.  Assessments should consist of the main ideas the lecturer is focused on and what they want the students to take away from the lesson; not something that is not significant or barely mentioned.  It was difficult to decide on what notes to take, as the lecturer could have spent a significant time discussing a subtopic and there was nothing on the quiz about that subtopic.  As an educator, I would probably use about 50% of the questions.  Also, there were “glitches” with the technology, as several times the quiz would “freeze” and when I tried to click the screen would eventually work but the click would change an answer (depending on where I had the mouse) or submit it when I was not finished.  This happened 3-4 times.  Thankfully, we could try again.  ",Lisa R,2020-08-15,4,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada

I think that this course provided an extremely in-depth overview and I cannot wait to dive deeper into these histories and complex societies. I even picked up The Indigenous Peoples of Canada Atlas collection for further reading. ",Andrew B,2020-08-06,5,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada

"As a recent immigrant to Canada I don't know much about Canadian history, let alone Indigenous history. I thought this was a fantastic introductory course to begin to understand the complex groups of people who make up this country. It has definitely inspired me to seek out more information on Indigenous groups local to me and other places I travel in North America. I do think it was a bit generalising at times but the hosts acknowledged they couldn't talk about every nation in Canada in depth so I am happy to forgive this. I would have liked to see more pictures in the Art course but I now have the suggestions to look these up in my own time. I also thought it was very helpful to learn what certain terms actually mean, e.g. First Nations vs Indigenous, because this is something I have not quite understood since I arrived.",Sarah F,2020-09-02,5,indigenous-canada,Indigenous Canada

I thought this would a good course for accomplishing this. It was a great course!!!! I learned so much in this course and it was easy to do so even as a busy professional. I encourage everyone to take this course. As we celebrate the Canada 150, we should be aware that we are many nations and a smaller part of a much bigger family with a much greater shared destiny. We must find ways to be much more aware of our colonial past and strive toward a much more inclusive future. There is much to learn and this course is a great survey course for getting started.

After certain lessons, I wanted to get a hold of the Bill of Rights and read everything that involves the Treaties, I know there's so much more to know!

"A well-structured course that has finally broken the morbid fear of CSS that has haunted me for the last 15 years! This builds very nicely on the work done in Intro to HTML5 from the same instructor. It doesn't, of course, teach every possible option in CSS3--it would need to be a year long and a lot less interesting to do that--but it does give some tolls which are immediately useful.I welcome the emphasis on standards compliance and accessibility which is all too often ignored.",Paul J M,2016-02-02,5,introcss,Introduction to CSS3

"Poor. 
Course crammed with unnecessary details (loads of CSS ""decoration"" properties that one may test on it's own), without focusing on CSS fundamentals, such as page layout strategies, float-based layouts, element positioning which, in my view, are discussed only very superficially. 
I'll forget 90% of discussed ""decoration"" properties in a few days  but when I think of CSS paradigms - a structure that can be later filled with easily forgotten/easily retrieved ""decoration"" properties   - that I'll take with me ""for ever"" out from this course.... sounds empty. The extra star goes for stressing the importance of accessibility.To sum up: decoration largely outweighs structure.

"Good course content, but I frequently got lost by the organization of the datasets, files, etc. I learned to set up neural networks but I can't, for example, see how to run them on data on my own computer. Data is just magically present during the course. Also, it would help to have the Laurence's notebooks available somewhere in the course summary. They are accessible in the unit AFTER he has talked through them in a video, but I always want to see them WHILE he's talking through them (not just the image in the video, the actual notebook), not afterwards.",Dave M,2020-05-13,3,introduction-tensorflow,"Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning"
"Nice course with some flaws. It’s a course in Keras with Tensorflow under the hood but you won’t see it. It’s great it’s Keras, however the title of the course is misleading. The videos are only a few minutes per week. Mostly it’s self-study on Google-Colaboratory. If you have no clue about Python or Machine Learning you might quickly be overwhelmed by the coding involved. If you have knowledge in Deep Learning you can earn this certificate within a few hours just by answering the (rather simple) quizzes even without watching the videos because the programming assignments are not graded.

"Overall this is a decent overview of security topics. I think the videos could be improved - there are too 
many 'talking heads' and not enough diagrammatic explanation. Also, the 
transcripts vary in places from what the speaker is saying - I suspect they are being created automatically.I had no problems with the online labs, although I think that some instructions might cause learners difficulty whose first language is not English.",Richard H,2019-11-29,3,it-security,IT Security: Defense against the digital dark arts

This course been milestone for my learning mandarin language journey, still far to go but here I can say I started the journey. Once again, many thanks to professor Xiaoyu Liu who designed very simple, interactive course and help to connect the Chinese language.

"There are issues with this course. My biggest gripe is that if you do not pass the tests on your first try, the questions and answers will change on your second time around. Obviously this is fine for the questions that you got wrong however it also changes the ones you got right. This makes the tests take MUCH longer than necessary and there isn't necessarily any extra learning gained from this. However, even with the problems with this course, you WILL learn how to use Python. I feel that the course succeeded in that regard - but I'm not sure that this course provides any benefits over following some YouTube tutorials. In conclusion, if you would like to learn how to use Python and don't mind something that is challenging and time consuming, take this course.

Videos and instructors are good but Not enough practice exercises and the interface is frustrating.   The left navigation pane shrinks becoming unusable so I have to restart the browser.    The quiz interface changes your answers during the quiz if you use the arrow keys.The first programming assignment for week 2 is needlessly complex.  the instructions arent clear.   its a shame to start with good lectures and ruin the course with nonsense.  lots of time required to understand what they are looking for instead of spending it on programming.   ,David E,2019-02-10,1,learn-to-program,Learn to Program: The Fundamentals

"I successfully completed my programming course today!! Yay me!!
During this course, I often got interested in a part of a lecture and would experiment with things on my own. A three minute video might take me an hour to watch because I wanted to try each thing on my own, not just see it done. They would describe a problem and I would try to figure out the solution on my own before watching them do it. Sometimes I wouldn't be able to figure it out but I'd be in a better position to understand the solution when it was presented.One other aspect I enjoyed was that if I wasn't sure about a test question, I could just use the tools and try it out. Sometimes things would work in a way that was surprising to me but I found that I learned a great deal in the process of testing. It is one of the big reasons that I like formative assessment - its effectiveness as a tool to improve learning, not just to test it after the fact.As much as I enjoyed the course, it also made me think a lot about how I'll do my courses in the future. While I very much enjoy in-person teaching, I've looked at the course as a model for how I might change the way I do retests, allow use of notes, and opportunities for design projects. I know that this first year back in is going to be a busy one but my brain is working and planning.I think part of this is just that as teachers, it is important for us to try things outside of our comfort zones. If we're going to try to help kids, we have to remember what it is like to have those, ""what are they talking about"" moments? Online lectures aren't as much fun but the ability to pause and take a sidequest was super-beneficial to me. How do I make that possible for my students?I guess part of all this is that after spending half my life teaching in Blue Valley, I am far from having all the answers. I think having the vulnerability to model that you are still learning and still messing up gives students some room to do the same.The ability to learn might well be our greatest gift. Let's keep using it.",John H,2020-06-11,5,learn-to-program,Learn to Program: The Fundamentals

After watching all the videos and completing the quizzes and assignments, I really feel that I have got a  good foundation in the basics of Python and I'm eager to further develop my skills. Both the instructors were very good, and went through each concept step-by-step in an efficient manner. The regular quizzes were a great test of my understanding of the subject content in the particular week. Personally, the best part of the course were the three assignments, which were wonderful opportunities for the learner to put their knowledge into practice. I had tons of fun completing the assignments, especially the last one involving a word game for which we were to write a major piece of the code. Finishing the assignments and quizzes was very rewarding. Finally I would like to mention how incredibly helpful the discussion forum is.

"I wanted to hold off on reviewing this course immediately after completing because learning is something that can only be demonstrated over a long period of time. I feel that it would be dishonest for anyone to review this kind of course which stresses the importance of spaced learning and long-term memory/chunking the moment it's finished.After closely practicing the methods and techniques (emphasis on spaced learning method and recall technique) throughout the course and finishing the Final exam of this course, I wrote down all the important terms, concepts, and techniques with each of their respective definitions on Quizlet.I put this whole Learning How to Learn course into the back of my mind for a month. No active reviewing of any of this material.A month goes and I check my to-do list and it says ""Do Quizlet's auto-generated tests which uses your key terms and definitions that you wrote down.

Great course. It's simple and straight to the point.

This is especially valuable to anyone just entering college or currently
 in college. Wish I knew a lot of these tricks and hacks and the general
 understanding of how the brain works back when I was still grinding 
through 50 topics a week.

As an upper 20-something, the most useful parts of this course are the 
videos that describe the fundamentals of how our brains work and getting
 through procrastination. Knowing how the diffuse mode works is HUGE. 
Taking rests are IMPORTANT and I never really thought that it so 
important. I just kind of had a ""feeling"" overtime. 

This course seriously changed my day-to-day learning. For real.

"I am new to Coursera so I have no idea of what is standard on here. Maybe this course is good relative to other courses on here, I don't know. However I do know that based on my experience I can not recommend paying for a coursera membership to take this course. This course comes with a total of less than 3.5hrs of instructional video. Considering linear algebra is usually taught with ~45 hrs of classroom instruction, this may seem short.. and it is. The course does a good job at explaining things at a conceptual level however it has few worked through example problems. The course uses quizzes and programming assignments as a way of reinforcing skills that you learn however the correct answers to the  questions on quizzes are never reviewed.

The explanatory videos are not bad and they are easily understood, but they seem to be a series of unrelated concepts, you wouldn't know why those concepts are explained and where the lecturers want to go.

"Challenging course. Much more difficult that I expected. It took me 7-9 hours a week. The overall course material itself was good building-blocks to further understand application of machine learning. However, explanation in some topics should have more detailed explanation and examples to further understand the concept. There were many times, I need to re-watch each video over and over again, paused it, and figured things out on my own. The programming assignments were the most challenging task. I just began to learn Python and found it very difficult because there were so many codes I haven't learnt before.

Thank you Andrew!",Peter W,2017-07-31,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning
"This is the course for which I have joined Coursera initially. Professor is very elaborate in explaining anything. I am a student from core Mathematics and Statistics background. But I feel that the course is designed in such a away that any students without having a high school level knowledge of basic mathematics and programming can grasp the ideas discussed here. But I would recommend this course as an introductory course to those who are rather interested in the core mathematics behind Machine Learning. For me, It was a good course to get a overview of Machine Learning as I didn't have a proper course in ML earlier. The positive thing is, a positive interest have been built regarding ML as I was learning from Professor Andrew. I will definitely go further to learn deeper in mathematics of  ML and it's improvements down the years. ",Rohit K,2019-06-17,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning
"I really enjoyed this course.  I believe it gives a great basic understanding of what machine learning is and how you can use it.  I feel that the  programming assignments could be broken up a little better to assess each section the way the PDF suggests to submit the results.  Or at least give an option to bail out of the code if you know you haven't completed the other sections.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the information provided and the instructor's teaching style.  I look forward to learning more on Coursera.",Jennifer G,2017-04-25,4,machine-learning,Machine Learning

"Course was very well structured and full of practical implementations. However, back propagation algorithm needs more elaboration. Also, there should be some extra videos (non compulsory) for those who want to learn the matrix operations used in algorithms (e.g. covariance defined as X'E(-1)X or use of Eigenvalues in dimentionality reduction). Apart from this, it's the best online course I have taken and it truly deserves to be the largest online course offered.",Kumar S,2015-10-04,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning

Reflecting on how it felt to be a student during the first few weeks, compared to now, it is obvious that a lot of learning and synthesis took place. Not having the mathematical or computer science background that one might expect for this type of work, I literally didn't know if I would make it through this. It was extremely well guided, and the mentor support was invaluable.",Alex J,2018-01-30,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning

The course content is vastly outdated and superficial. ,Reinhard H J,2019-10-18,1,machine-learning,Machine Learning
"I am a physician with a degree in CS, passionate about informatics applications in healthcare. I have finished this course and - WOW - what an eye opener, mind blowing educational experience it was.Andrew Ng gently takes us from the buzzwords to a clear methodology and the current ML tools kit used by ML practitioners. As the last time I've played with matrices, vectors, linear algebra and calculus - was many years ago in high school, I was a bit anxious about the math level required. Andrew has carefully calibrated the amount of math pain involved and for this I'd like to thank him again and again, as it allows individuals with little math or programming skills to understand and internalize the most important principles of state-of-the-art ML.Highly recommended !",Alexander S,2018-07-06,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning
Excellent! I have a background in linear algebra and Matlab but ML is new to me. The flow of information is managed almost perfectly and I can follow very easily. I cannot image a more efficient way to learn about this topic. I especially appreciate the real life implementation insights from Andrew and how different tools are being applied at different settings. The support team also did a great job in responding to questions. Overall this is my best online learning experiences and I would definitely take other courses and recommend this to other people. Thanks for a great job well done.,James M,2017-09-21,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning

"This is a great course. I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting, never boring way. Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies, it was easy to follow the course, because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum. It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs, this topic was handled a little too short for my taste. All in all, it is a pity, that professor Ng does not offer a corresponding specialization. I would enroll immediately.",Peter H,2017-02-11,5,machine-learning,Machine Learning

Excellent,Ryan H,2018-04-30,5,machine-learning-projects,Structuring Machine Learning Projects
"(09/2019)Overall the courses in the specialization are great and provide great introduction to these topics, as well as practical experience. Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.There are a few shortbacks:1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it. So in the end it’s worth it. Not sure I would have taken it as a stand-alone course, though.5 - Slide graphics and Andrew handwriting could be improved. 6 - the online Coursera Jupyter notebook environment was a bit slow, and sometimes get stuck. Again overall - highly recommended",David R,2019-10-01,3,machine-learning-projects,Structuring Machine Learning Projects

It would be far better if AN actually discussed previous cases and what pitfalls to watch out for. For example, it's useful for practitioners to understand human component features that he mentions. He's probably seen a lot of instances in which engineers came up with great ideas that ended up differentiating a mediocre-performing algorithm from a far better one.  He could also discuss go into greater case study detail of instances in which transfer learning/muti-task learning worked well or not.

Week 3 was definitely heavy and challenging in the middle of it, but the course really builds up well and makes sense by the end of it and I understand why those topics were combined as they were.  I found the labs most helpful when they included # hashtag explanations/documentations when introducing new code to explain the different parameters and reasons for using them, or if establishing parameters in the code with explanatory definitions/names to guide the user through new operations.  In the very last lab, I think they included a link to the pandas API reference page with that specific new operation.

"As am going along in this IBM certification, the quality of courses is getting depleted. This course has by far the worst standard in terms of quality of content and assignments. The worst part is that they encourage you to use IBM cloud services which are the worst and require improvement themselves. But the worst part was the peer guided assignment. With no clear instructions, peers that have no idea checking your assignments and long delay for waiting the grade for it, god help you! Don't waste money on this course.

"At first this class seemed easy to follow, but that was deceptive. While I learned some theory (and some mathematics) behind the algorithms we were meant to learn, there was far too little emphasis on how and when to run the actual code. Normally the labs are a helpful part of these courses, wherein I have the opportunity to actually learn code. Not so with this course. When I reached the final project for this class, I had no clue how to do what we were supposed to do, as essentially, it had not been taught within the course. I had to seek out other sources in order to actually learn the material and make a lot of educated guesses about what I was suppose to do. I suspect (or hope) that much of this will become easier when I re-take Statistics and some other maths (not course requirements), but that won't make up for the deficiencies in the course. Lastly, the typos and other grammatical errors are extremely distracting and misleading (i.e. ""lables"" -- do they mean ""tables"" or ""labels""? Who can say for sure!).

The rubric for the last assignment was too arbitrary. People with little to no machine learning experience will assume that submissions have to be cookie-cutter copies of previous labs in order to achieve 100%. I would put force students to put random seed on models in order to achieve similar results to achieve more homogeneity and therefore an easier way to grade. Perhaps you could put a section at the end that allows for further parameter tuning if the student so desires.,Andrew B,2019-07-01,4,machine-learning-with-python,Machine Learning with Python

"Like many of the courses, the instructions are not in a format that supports incremental learning and focuses on the mechanics for performing an activity rather than an explanation for why and the reason we are doing these things. The objectives and measures of success for the final exercise is not clearly articulated, causing me to guess as to what the evaluator had wanted us to do. The instructions said to solve for the four types of methods, but left it to the student as to if they wished to generate graphics, etc. If the only objective was to generate the Jaccard score, F1 score, and LogLoss (as appropriate) to complete the activities, then it should have been stated. In addition, the examples presented in the course labs did not have us generating the F1 and Jaccard scores for many of the models.",Tom S,2020-05-13,2,machine-learning-with-python,Machine Learning with Python

"Though similar in many ways to Learning How to Learn, I thought the emphasis in this course on how we can understand and use learning to better ourselves and actually shift our lives and careers was particularly impactful. The key insights, for me, include: knowing that I have to practice things and that conceptual understanding isn't the optimal goal; that one's environment, both people and place, impact learning; that boys have slower verbal advancement on average than girls (that has quite an impact on areas of focus and society); that reframing can actually cause a neurological shift to make things easier to deal with; that learning styles aren't proven; and using a ""Pi"" approach to learning can be advantageous.

Really great course!,Lucas T,2015-12-06,5,ml-foundations,Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
A great tutorial on using machine learning tools and a very basic intro into machine learning concepts. Doesn't go into how they work at all which is what the other courses are for.Given its basically a tutorial for graphlab create (awesome but commercial software) it would be nice if it also covered pandas directly also. If people are really expecting to head into this field they are likely at some point going to have to use the cheaper tools.It would be great if this module was optional for the larger machine learning certificate. That said I found this class was valuable in preparing me for the next courses in that it got me familiar with the tools and the rhythm of the quizes and assignments.

"Might be good for someone looking for a casual overview?I really wanted to like this course, and was excited about the series. Very disappointing. Refunded after scoring 100% on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week 4. I was familiar, with the subject prior to taking this course; was hoping for a deep dive.Too many trivially short and low information density videos. Handwavy mathematics. I would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing money.Default software for the course has near-zero market penetration (per indeed.com), unless maybe you work at Apple -- not really excusable for something that purports real-world value. Yes, you can use other software,  *except for the capstone*, per another reviewer: this is fatal.Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on clustering: ""So, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval. Or any other really, really, really cool retrieval that I can't think of right now. But of course there's lots of interesting examples. So go out there and think of ideas that I can't think of right now."" Really? How about: ""Cut! Take two.""Many poor design choices for the presentation. Too much 
time spent writing things on slides that should have already been on the slides.As of this review: no reviews on the last courses in the series, and some poor (but indicative) reviews of the other courses.",Mike L,2016-09-07,1,ml-foundations,Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach

"Course doesn't do nearly enough to bring you up to speed on using mathlab or iPython notebook.  I am currently learning to program python and a lot of this stuff was well above my head.The quizzes and assignments do very little to reinforce the work, and often come down to trial and error.  I  wanted to learn the mechanics of machine learning from this course, but it is too complex, and presented in such an arcane manner to serve as an introduction, but doesn't go deep enough to really teach anything useful.  I'd suggest you look at Wikipedia or YouTube for better classes.I'd like to draw special attention to the quizzes, as often they're on trivia from the lectures and not reflective of the actual nuts and bolts of working with machine learning.

"Amazing course. Gives a great insight into Machine Learning. If you're skeptical about what machine learning is, this is the course to take. ",Sandeep J,2016-01-09,5,ml-foundations,Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
"If you are already familiar with ML you won't learn anything new. The deep learning part is new, but it too short and lacks detail. I believe the concepts are explained in a clear manner but they are too high-level to be considered ""learning"". By the end of the course you will be familiar with some concepts of ML and the Graphlab API, but you won't be ready to implement anything by your own. However, I think this course is good to evaluate whether you like the teaching style and the overall style of the specialization. It would be nice to be able to skip this course and still get the specialization completed. if you already know what you want to learn and you don't want the the full specialization certificate jump into the other courses right away.  I will continue with the specialization with the hope in the next courses the topics are covered in higher detail.

"This course is excellent for anybody new to machine learning and wanting to learn this new skill from the top down. For me, I have a strong background in machine learning, not in the context of big data, but I wanted to get familiar with Python and learn how modern companies are using machine learning in practice. This course provides that applied approach to implementing a broad range of machine learning applications with Python, applied to real problems.A course this small cannot provide everything - what this course does not provide is in-depth technical tutorials on the workings of machine learning algorithms. There are many courses out there which do, but this course to great for learning a practical approach to problem solving with machine learning and data processing.If there is a downside, I would say that the use of paid packages in the lectures (graphlab) limits the student's ability to learn Python using the freely available packages on the web, which was my personal preference. However, this is not purely negative, since there are many employers out there who would like to know that you have practical knowledge of things like AWS and graphlab. I did enjoy learning about those packages and services and I feel like I learned something positive which I can share with potential employers.Overall, a very good concise course - one of the best on Coursera for vocational learning in my opinion.",Ryan C,2016-08-22,5,ml-foundations,Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach

"After finishing first course from Andrew, I've found this one much simpler to understand, especially the back propagation; This might be because this course was solely oriented to neural networks (leaving behind linear regression or unlabeled learning algorithms), and that on the previous course I've already had to rationalize the back prop process.Anyway, the explanations are much clearer on this course, the only thing I miss is the Errata section, tutorials and week's notes.",Alejandro A,2018-03-07,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning

"Great Explaination, No need prior knowledge of tedious maths, he awesome trainer.  ",Rahul P,2020-04-22,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"The course expands on the neural network portion of Andrew Ng's original Machine Learning course, but ported over to Python. Even though it is spread out over 4 weeks, it really doesn't cover any additional material. Instead, Ng repetitively goes over the math and coding with vectors in Python, while stressing how hard the calculus derivation would be. This might all be helpful to you if calculus was not your strong suit, but my guess is that if you have any kind of background in computer science or statistics, the math in this course would be almost elementary. The assignments are done on Python Jupyter notebooks, which has the advantage of a standard environment, but disadvantage in that it hides some abstractions. Specifically, you lose the sense of what the actual code would look like in a Python IDE. Sure, you can download the notebooks as .py files. Much of the code is pre-written, and you only fill in a few lines of code in each assignment. It would take a lot of self-study on what's actually going on in setting up the programs to actually be able to self-write a neural network. Although Python is without question more popular in machine learning than Octave, it is more popular because of its library support, and in a course that requires you to build your own neural network instead of using libraries (besides numpy), that doesn't matter. I preferred doing the assignments in Octave rather than the notebooks.Since it is impossible to purchase this course on its own, perhaps the bigger question is whether the specialization is worth it. Courses 4 and 5 are not up at the time of this review, but Course 3 is only 2 weeks with 2 quizzes and no programming assignments, and Course 2 is about hyperparameter tuning, arguably the most novel in the 3 courses, but still not something that deserves its own specialization or even its own course. My suggestion is to watch all the lectures for free. And then use your free week to do the programming assignments, which you can probably finish in a day, across all the courses.",Jonathan C,2017-08-20,2,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The course was structured very well and was very easy to follow.I underestimated the knowledge of math required for deep learning. I was never very good at math and it really has been a while I learned vectors, matrices, calculus etc., but this course gave a nice introduction to the math that is needed. However, for me personally, I still had to go back and learn the basic math concepts. Khan Academy and YouTube videos were very helpful.I am very good in coding. However this course made me realize that there is not much coding as such for deep learning. Python libraries really makes it easy. You need to understand the mathematics and formulas, and after that, its all about the test data and your hyper parameters.Unfortunately I have to take a break as I have to travel for business, but I am highly motivated and I will definitely return and complete the other courses for specialization.",Rajneesh S,2017-10-08,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
I have learn basics of neural networks and its working. This specialization is really amazing everyone should take it for better insights of deep learning. ,Sanjay K,2018-04-23,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Great course, easy to follow and with exercises that really help the learner to digest the knowledge and make it real!",David,2019-07-24,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
The best course I have attended in NN and DL. It's amazing how easy the concepts are explained. The examples and practical exercises are great to understand much better these concepts.,José L,2020-04-13,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
As usual with Andrew's courses the assignments are really helpful. The only thing I think that needs to be improved is the last section doing backpropagation over multiple layers. There were some helper functions that we called from another file but I felt we should have seen those more easily to learn them. Also was a little confused about the indexing of some of the stored parameters. Would like to have seen the equations next to the code. Awesome course!,Adam S,2017-10-08,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Really Good course , Would be able to understand it if you have descent knowledge in algebra and matrices ! Overall Very good .",Sahil S,2020-09-28,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
The organization of this course is really awesome. I have learnt how to make a deep neural network step by steps. Thank you Andrew.,Md. A A,2020-05-13,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Great course, I'll definitely be taking the next one in the specialization! Some of the programming assignments seemed like the instructions gave away too many spoilers, but I suppose that's probably reasonable for the introductory course in the sequence.",John C,2017-10-07,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
A very nice and intuitive introduction to neural networks and deep learning. The conventions and notations used for the neural networks are carefully chosen and facilitates learning. I also obtained deeper intuition for the neural networks thanks to this course.,Tahir M,2017-09-28,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Good to get started with,Harshit S,2019-06-25,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"I loved the learning experience. Complex topics have been covered in a very step by step manner that is easy to digest. Being familiar with calculus helped me understand math and derivations of the formulae used. I would suggest adding additional  (optional) videos that dwell a bit more in the math behind backpropagation.  Otherwise, I am highly satisfied with the course.",Adarsh S,2020-05-06,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Would be better with more optional video to go further in some calculation for people with more knowledge in calculus.Otherwise amazing.,Gabriel S,2018-06-13,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This course was so good. I actually feel like working in whole advanced level deep learning environment,Aditya G,2018-09-27,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Clear and structured approach to NN's.  I enjoyed the building of intuitions around gradients, and feel I've gained a much clearer understanding of the basics.  Excited for the rest of the specialization! ",John H,2017-12-05,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"A little bit too much spoon feeding, but good for the basics. ",Patrick C,2019-11-25,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
There are some grading issues in the programming assignments but the course is great!,Eric S,2018-01-30,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"This is a very well produced and execute course. The instruction material was carefully crafted to efficiently teach the material while providing interesting and useful insights and guidance. I appreciated the optional videos and study material in the programming projects, as well as links for further exploration. The course was extremely interesting.",Bo S,2017-11-18,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"The computation graph way of looking at the forward and backprop is such a good idea. I now have a better understanding of what Neural Nets are and their inner workings. Thank you, Andrew!",Sandeep T,2020-06-29,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Complex subject taught in most simple form. Great to learn. Video from experts in the field is really inspiring. Thanks Andrew.,Sai P P,2019-08-30,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"This field of deep learning has always intrigued me and I wanted to study it. My university offered a course, but sadly I couldn't enroll in it. However, thankfully, I got access to this masterpiece and now I can say that by completing course 1, I am pretty confident about neural networks and how to construct one.Great Couse, and Great Instructor. Would Definitely RECOMMEND!!!",Muhammad T,2020-05-10,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Amazing Course,Saad A,2020-07-23,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"This course is not only appropriate for the those who study NN first time, but also for those who have a certain degree of theoretical knowledge. This course gave me some really good practice which can help me understand the usage and principal of mathematic algorithms.",John W,2017-12-08,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Really cool! Gives you guided experience on how to design your own deep neural networks! Maybe gives you too much guidance sometimes,Juan M,2020-09-06,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Python assignments are way too easy and can be completed without actually understanding what you are doing. Quizes can be retaken until you get it right. So basically, you can pass the course without watching most of the lectures, if you wanted. So it's not a certificate i'm proud of at all.",Ricardo C,2019-06-21,2,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Another good course by Andrew Ng and his team. Excellent presentation and flow information. Very good means of presenting course assignments.,Rohit G,2019-01-25,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Excellent course,Santosh K,2018-11-05,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Great introduction into ML. Catchy.Really bearable, calculus and linear algebra-wise. Some insights into program code implemented caches would be a huge help in gripping the code logic.",Alexey Z,2020-07-09,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Best beginner's course on neural networks ever, taught by one of the greatest men in this field, divided into small, understandable lectures, challenging notebooks with ample support materials and great sets of quizzes. Couldn't ask for anything more.",Shalini S,2020-06-07,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
I feel there could be some more of coding videos rather than just explaining the concepts.,NIKHIL S,2020-05-01,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
I must say it was as in-depth as I needed to create a strong knowledge baseline. Now it will be way easier to dive into articles and textbooks!,George P,2020-05-03,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"That was far easier than the ML course I think, maybe a little bit too much ;)",Gabriel B,2017-08-27,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This is really an excellent course. In particular the notebooks are very well done. I passed the course but have to admit that I still need to go back to be fully clear on the dimensions of the vectors and matrix as well as how all the helper functions we implemented play together. But this is what I was looking for. An example where you really get through the network development and understand step by step what is happening. Thank you Andrew and team. I am looking forward to the other courses of the specialization.,Christian B,2018-08-24,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
I learnt a lot about deep learning from this course. Thanks a lot,Pranav K,2019-07-15,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Excellent introduction to NN.,Saurabh P,2018-02-17,4,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"I already have practical experience using neural nets with the keras/tensorflow framework. Nevertheless, this course has further improved my insight in the mechanics of neural nets, as you are forced to build neural nets yourself from scratch. Highly recommended. ",Steven M,2020-04-02,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning
A very nice and intuitive introduction to neural networks and deep learning. The conventions and notations used for the neural networks are carefully chosen and facilitates learning. I also obtained deeper intuition for the neural networks thanks to this course.,Tahir M,2017-09-28,5,neural-networks-deep-learning,Neural Networks and Deep Learning

"The assignments can be made a little difficult. Can Include assignments of Image captioning, that would have been great. Overall a great course. Sir Andrew Ng, superb teaching!!",Rahul S,2018-05-27,4,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"This course offers a great introduction to the models: RNN, GRU and LSTM.In addition, it illustrates the power of ""Word Embedding"" and ""Attention Model"". The programming assignments are interesting, provide deeper understanding of the models, and show how simple it is to implement these models in Keras.",Pavel K,2019-02-05,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
A very well organized introduction to the wonderland of Recurrent Neural Networks. The course takes the student through multiple use cases of various RNN architectures with practical advice on how and where to use them.  The awesome programming assignments with excellent documentation is a highlight! ,Akshay M P,2020-09-29,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"I guess as the subject matter becomes more complex, more training is required on the underlying frameworks being used- Keras, TensorFlow etc. Did not feel that sufficient time was spent on understanding the underlying frameworks. Also the TA work is of spotty quality. But I love the way Andrew teaches.",Suresh D,2018-03-26,3,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"The course lecture is grade but I hope the assignment is better in guiding structure, something the explanation is hard to follow, and the assignment should include the transfer learning instead of using the trained model.",Nguyen H S,2018-10-21,4,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"One of the best courses, really beautifully done by Andrew Ng.",Suman C,2018-04-10,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
coding style is out-of-date. Could the TA update the coding homework regularly?,Yu L,2020-05-21,4,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"course is a little bit too light on the explanation, need to rewatch videos a few times.",Mark L,2018-07-01,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"Assignments were extremely didactic; there was no room for creativity. They were not transparent and gave a minimal idea of how to implement these things properly. Course moderators did not bother to answer any of my queries, making the course even less intellectually stimulating. The lectures were monotonous,  and hence, I was having trouble finding them to be very engaging. Although, the professor did give some insightful points. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this course to someone unless they are extremely novice programmers. Yet, one may refer to the videos to gain some conceptual clarity on specific topics.",Rohan G,2020-07-18,2,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models

"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. The descriptions of GRUs and LSTMs were a little scant, however, and I found myself rewatching the videos trying to get my head around them. The course could be improved by going into a little more detail about the different gates and what it means to train them, or what sorts of information or patterns might be relevant for the training of a gate.",David C,2018-08-23,4,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"I really liked this last course as I did not have much experience with NLP and with audio in general, as I did have with computer vision and image processing.

 Programming assignments were not to the level of the prior courses in the series. Should have more illustration of using Keras/Tensorflow. Assignments either were too spoon fed or there was too little reference information whereas prior courses had a good balance.

Very informative course,Saurabh S,2019-05-17,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"This is definitely a top-flight course and supremely useful!  I learned many new things about practical applications of recurrent neural networks in this class and found the natural language emphasis to be very useful, particularly for certain problems I have been working on for some time!  Professor Ng's lectures are very well-organized and clear and follow a very logical sequence.  The assignments, especially the programming assignments, are well designed and do a very good job of building upon what is taught in the lectures and add a great deal of value to this class.  I especially like the fact that we worked so much with Keras, which is an important framework for building Deep Learning systems and which is so widely used (it is the framework I often use in my own projects), and I acquired a lot of new knowledge about Keras thanks to this course.  Overall, it was a superb learning experience, and I will be recommending this to both friends and colleagues.",Ryan M,2018-02-19,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models

"Though there are some minor lost clarifications in the flow, the general learning experience of this course is overwhelmingly practical and relevant to many real world scenarios. Personally felt this course completed the knowledge graph (of course I only have a preliminary understanding of everything) and opens many doors for future learning.One nit-pick is Keras documentation can be annoying confusing and misleading at times. Would suggest to revise programming assignment instructions based on some popular threads in Forum discussions.",Sikang B,2018-04-01,5,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models
"This course has great material on sequence models, presented with the usual energy and enthusiasm that Andrew Ng brings to every course.  The model diagrams are great for visualizing what's actually going on in the complex assignments, and the assignments are generally designed with 1) additional code and commentary to make the examples informative and 2) the ""guard rails"" (e.g., insert code here, with related hints)  to clarify the specific lines to edit.  Having said that, I feel that the assignments were a little less polished/refined relative to earlier courses in the concentration, and I spent significantly more time in the discussion forums than I had in prior courses.  I also recommend investing in additional training in Keras and Tensor Flow as a prerequisite or in parallel to this course to help get the most out of the practical applications of the material.",Ken K,2019-10-06,4,nlp-sequence-models,Sequence Models

"like all the courses i had a lot of trouble just accessing the linux lab with my chromebook. The instructions are incomplete in the labs and led to countless hours spent with help desk staff just trying to enter or setup the lab.....ultimately the solution was very simple but after countless hours, trying six or seven times just trying to get either cloudshell or secureshell up and running to do a simple lab, a helpdesk person gave me a simple bit of information which had i known a month ago could have saved me hours of headaches. The course was ok but i found the instructor would just breathe past command lines too quickly, moving on before i could really absorb what she was saying. A bit more explanation and a slower pace at times would have been helpful. Also a bit more explanation of the spacing in command lines would have been nice.

It was all quite interesting, but it was difficult finding the jumping off point at course two where the content picked up in course three...there seemed to be some kind of in-between course missing.Also, the weekly qwiklabs would do better to build off each other while repeating more knowledge over again (i.e. week one = task A; week two = tasks A and B; week three = tasks A, B, and C, etc.) , than just jumping from topic to topic with a large wrap-up of everything at the end.Best,John Marshall",John M,2019-09-18,3,os-power-user,Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User

One of the most beautiful and challenging course I have come across.,amin s,2020-05-06,5,philosophy,Introduction to Philosophy
"I decided to take this course because I've been interested in philosophy for a long time, yet studied computing and online and distance education academically. Meanwhile, I've read a lot of books on philosophy, theology and psychology over the years and always thought these would be subjects I'd study in my retirement years. So, when this current pandemic came to disrupt my usual schedule, I began by reading some books that I thought would keep me mentally active throughout this period of time. But then, I thought, wow; I've actually got the perfect opportunity to do a MOOC on some of these subjects and gain a verifiable certificate. Excellent. You don't need to have studied Philosophy at all before doing this course; it's very well presented and I've found it very clear and easy to follow. It's given me a sense of achieving something whilst I've not been able to go to work, so that has also made it absolutely worthwhile doing. I'm now feeling like I can actually fit in a more courses throughout the remaining time I have on this planet. Thank you to everyone who put this course together, I've loved it.",Kevin R,2020-05-26,5,philosophy,Introduction to Philosophy

"There is stuff to be learned here, but... The course delivery is dreadful. The lectures are extremely repetitive and you will have to sit through hours of Martin Seligman talking about which VIP he sat next to at a very important function and every other unimportant detail to get to the crux of the information. This course comes across as a sales pitch much of the time, (as do his books). A shame, as his philosophy is indeed very helpful and the strategies he suggests (when you finally get to hear them) can be life changing.",Anna S,2018-06-29,1,positive-psychology-visionary-science,Positive Psychology: Martin E.

"Generally excellent! Reading around other online introductory resources the difference in clarity from the creator of the language, Martin Odersky in this course is very clear. I feel I have a good base to continue my learning from. To make it even better as an introduction I would have liked 3 things. Firstly more examples and exercises. along with the more challenging ones, more correct vs incorrect examples exercises, to reinforce the theoretical understanding that is so clearly present. This would translate more quickly into practical coding skills.  Secondly some more tips on the development environment, specifically how to get the debugging tools working. Lastly, updating the code base to the lastest versions of Scala and SBT, so there are no deprecation warnings when building. Having said all that, I'm really happy to have found this course and excited now I've completed it to continue my learning of Scala.",Joe H,2018-09-05,5,progfun1,Functional Programming Principles in Scala

"I have been programming in Java over the past few years. So, when I first encountered Scala code at work earlier this year, I was under the impression that I could just go through other developer's code in my project codebase and learn the basics of Scala. However, as weeks went by, I realized that I knew only bits and pieces of the language; and often, I was left scratching my head in bewilderment at some of the functional style code that I came across very frequently. This was when I decided to enroll in this course, and I think it was one of the best decisions I made. Professor Martin Odersky covers the concepts of Scala and Functional Programming so well, with all the in-depth examples. However, the real icing on the cake is the assignment every week. I really had fun completing all the course work and I can safely say that I have learnt much more than I could have by just going through bits and pieces of other developer's code in a Scala codebase, in the same amount of time.",Samir S,2020-05-25,5,progfun1,Functional Programming Principles in Scala

Odersky is that rare professor that's not only an expert but an exceptionally good teacher with a passion for the subject. Don't skip the optional lectures, every video is filled with gems. If you really want to know functional programming (for that matter, if you really want to know object orient programming) this course is for you.

"The grading seems to round up to 100%, which makes the assignments that are already generally easy far too easy. I took this course instead of just doing my own thing so that I could get some structure and motivation. While there was some structure, it was quite basic, and the motivation was diminished by ""good enough"" not being much. I was considering taking the later courses in the specialization, but I'm afraid that without real grading I won't learn as much as if I learn more slowly outside of Coursera.",Michael S,2017-02-13,3,progfun1,Functional Programming Principles in Scala

"IMHO the difference of functional programming to imperative programming wasn't very clear. On the other hand, this course gives a good grasp on handling and writing Scala code. Martin does a great job in his videos.NOTE: the programming excerises need some scruitinization. They are a bit misleading here and there. In particular some important tests are missing and it takes big effort to understand what is going wrong sometimes. Tests as such are just a translation of functional specifications into code and should hence be as comprehensive as possible.",Anas A,2020-07-15,4,progfun1,Functional Programming Principles in Scala

It's my recommendation that any novice must gather information regarding things discussed in this course as it will be helpful during practice quizzes of this course.Above all, it is really serving its purpose of strengthening your programming fundamentals but for that, you must already have some fundamentals to get strengthen. Also if you opt for this course make yourself sure to also opt for all other courses of this specialization. After completion of this specialization, you will have a lot of new skills for sure including Linux and UNIX.As this specialization is not a cakewalk so you must have to remain motivated throughout.Also, lots of stuff to read makes it irritating.

",Rahul D,2020-09-23,5,programming-fundamentals,Programming Fundamentals
"After perusing older books on program design and flow-charting, my takeaway was that I couldn't get a handle on the logic flow required to create an algorithm that involved branching and iteration. Then I thought that I should also devote some study to Discrete Mathematics to have the foundation that is inherent in a computer science curriculum. While this background information is useful, I lacked the ability to tie it all together while plodding along on my own. It was the same feeling of defeat that I have felt before at first blush. As I thought back along past learning experiences, I still stubbornly insisted that a good teacher could teach anyone a difficult subject with the right approach. First, I heard about Code Academy and Udemy and was drawn to a Unix course given my dabbling with Linux opensource. But then I stumbled across Programming Fundamentals and its claim that their method would work. At present I have abandoned the Unix course and feel awful about being a quitter. However, this course offers a systematic approach or essentially an algorithm or series of steps to create programming algorithms and then proceeds to address how to flesh it out in C code. Intuition suggests that the actual pedagogy might come from thinking inductively like you would in Discrete Math going from an instance and then generalizing, .i.e, if true for k then k+1 then you can reason by induction as you would a mathematical proof. Nevertheless, the framework upon which this approach is based is like the Wizard of Oz off in the wings while I just enjoy tapping my intellect and thinking there is no place better than the light at the end of the tunnel. And I'm glad my personal quest to realize the process of algorithm to code can finally manifest itself to some degree. Thank you so much for creating  an instructional marvel.

"The description says this course is for beginners to programming, but you are expected to know more than the instructors to pass some of the quizzes, and there is no help for your incorrect answers.  Do not pay for this course unless you know you can pass the quizzes, especially the quizzes for week 3.

Wish I'd been told before starting how much content relied on having the PMBOK book. Lack of linear structure to the planning process was quite confusing.

For instance, every lesson that has slides is allocated 10 minutes, but some may contain 40 slides, meaning you only get 15 seconds for each slide!

"I work in lesson design and blended learning teacher training. I train teachers how to combine effective teaching practices with technology in K-8 classrooms. There is lots of room for improvement in this course. I would not recommend it to someone with no experience. I have no experience in coding, and did well in this course because I went to other sources to answer my questions and fill the knowledge gaps in this course. Though the instructor was great. He seems very passionate.From a teaching/pedagogy standpoint the scope and sequence was poor. It went from extremely broad (defining computer parts) to hyper specific (defining variables in python) really quick. There was no information between on the practical pieces of what python is, what it looks like on our computer, and how we interact with it.It feels like multiple people got together to build the course, but after it was finished they never came back to say “Here’s where we didn’t communicate, let’s edit these things.”There is a HUGE disconnect between writing python programs and running them vs. running the actual python platform and typing commands line by line. The most frustrating thing was that every example in the course was given as a line of code in the python platform with the chevron prompt, and every single assignment was about writing a program in the text editor and the running the program. I didn’t realize these were two completely different things until about week 6. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS. Make it clear for future students that this is a thing. Go over how to use both, and the benefits and drawbacks of each. Make it clear that your examples are taking place in the command line python platform, but our homework is writing programs and saving and running them. I didn’t understand the use of the ‘type’ function until I realized this discrepancy. This was so confusing.Some of the quiz questions were very specific questions that were mentioned for about a second or never explicitly made clear. Some of the ideas that were emphasized or mentioned multiple times in the same lecture video (seemed important) were never asked on the quiz. I can give examples of both. I learned some stuff, but overall I would not recommend this course without pointing to the discrepancies. I would say there are multiple obvious areas for improvement and multiple gaps in knowledge that I filled from other sources. I could give more specific examples, but I feel like I already wrote quite a bit.",Daniel D,2019-01-21,2,python,Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

"This course is amazing! Like 'hello world' is the first code that almost every programmer writes, I recommend everyone to take this course as  a first step towards learning Python or starting to code as a whole. Thanks to Dr. Chuck aka Dr. Charles Severance, the professor and University of Michigan for making it fun and not boring or bewildering.

"I liked the course.I did it very fast as I do have a programming background.I liked the lecturer and the way of how the lectures material was provided. However, the course could have been improved if some extra materials like code listings or some stuff like ""python reserved words"" chart were saved and available along with the video materials.You can find all of these in internet or while reviewing the video materials for sure, however once you have to recall smth from the course very fast - you have to either go through video or go through google. It is not a problem, it is just some kind of UX flaws as of me.In general, I liked the course and I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to feel the taste of programming in Python.

"Dr. Chuck is awesome!  I audited this and the beginner class to prepare for a training course for work . I needed to prepare to learn an AV system control scripting software that uses a Python-based language. I tried some Code Academy lessons and some other short interactive tutorials but I just wasn't getting the deeper, meaningful learning experience that I was looking for. This truly feels like having access to a university course on the subject (if you continue with the other courses in this specialization after this). The lectures are great, I highly recommend also reading the textbook as well to get a deeper understanding, and doing the auto-grader assignments to verify your working knowledge is a great tool. The time and effort commitment for the first 2 courses has felt like a light load, a great way to get started if you're feeling overwhelmed about learning a scripting language. Thank you Dr. Chuck!!!!",Danielle B,2018-01-20,5,python-data,Python Data Structures

The way everything was explained made them easy to understand and, even as someone with a little bit of python experience, there were new things to learn. Videos and explination were all understandable and the excercises were, in my opinion, a good challenge and helped reinforce the things you learned in the lectures.

The basic skill on how to get data from the csv files and excel files. Cleaning and manupulating and making dataframes are taught in the course. I am giving a comparitvely low score because there are multiple things i didnt like:The professeor and the tutor in the video lectures are too boring. Straight forward they keep on taking and playing a video in which the codes are written at lightning fast speeds.It becomes hard to keep up with learning as it goes super fast. They just keep on talking before a letting a person digest the syntax of code. The assignments were super difficult for a beginner like me and the questions wording omgggg! The questions aren't framed well at all had to keep searching the discussion forums.Not for the beginners course as it becomes too difficult to keep up with. Just keep searching forums in the clue of getting the syntax. Really i was not much impressed by the professor. They should definitely make it more interactive rather than super boring.,Aarya P,2020-09-16,3,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python

Excellent Course for beginners to start learning pandas and get a pretty good hands on experience in it.

I actually enjoyed the fact that the assignments didn't hold your hand and forced students to solve problems with the forum and other resources. Look forward to the rest of the courses in this specialisation!  Two aspects you could improve is teaching is (1) Multiindex and (2) Regex. It seemed like you purposely avoided discussing these.

"Some 2 years after finishing this course, I cannot stress enough how much I have gained from this course (or the full specialization for that matter). Having started this specialization as a social science researcher with a solid background in traditional statistical research (and total beginner with Python), I have actually managed to find a job as a Data Scientist halfway through this specialization. This course and specialization will teach you how to use all the commonly used Python libraries for Data Science applications (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK etc.). And comparing to some of the other specializations I've taken in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Maths after completing this one, I can say that the programming assignments are by far the best I've encountered on Coursera so far. The learning curve is pretty steep at first (it was for a total beginner like me) but you'll learn a lot quickly. And by the end you'll be able to do most Data Science tasks independently. Highly recommended! ",Martin B,2019-06-25,5,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python
The videos and programming assignments were engaging and challenging.

"Course material is good esp. the assignments force you to learn a lot more.  However, the instruction is not comprehensive.  A few assignments were also ambiguous.  The support forum is quite good but it would have been much better 1) if instructors would cover key topics a bit more in detail,  2) Easy to find auto grader scripts so one can understand the error or provide a better feedback mechanism from autograder.  I had a spelling error in the answer and it took me 4 hours to correct it. Once I had the autograder code, the bug was very easy to catch. ",Rakesh S,2018-10-08,3,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python
"This is not a course, rather just guidance to use StackOverflow. The trainer Prof. Brooks is highly unlively and plainly reads out/speaks some statements. He teaches only 10%, remaining 90% you need to explore on your own. The Assignments have the most difficult questions and for solving them, students are not even given any getting-started questions, to begin with! If you wish to learn Data Science/Data Analysis then I would not recommend this course since it is not worth the time, effort and money. Also, the title of the course is devaluing the efforts we put it. The entire course is focused towards using Pandas to perform Data Analysis / Data Cleaning / Data Wrangling / Data Munging / Data Preprocessing and thus I would recommend that the title of the course should be one of these rather than ""Introduction ..."" which hardly gives any weight to what hard work this certification demands!In the brief course videos professor makes some hand gestures and the background shows the people working - both has no relevance and rather prove to be a distraction. Above that auto-grader comes with its own lot of problems which consume hours and days of all the candidates. This course is online for more than 2 years now and I doubt if Coursera really takes such feedback seriously and takes any action for improvement!Request Coursera / UM to go through all the reviews:https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-introduction-to-data-science-in-python-6671",Pratik M,2019-02-15,1,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python
"Com certeza o curso melhorou o meu conhecimento em python. Antes mesmo de terminá-lo já aplicava os conhecimentos no meu trabalho. Contudo, terminei trabalhando muito mais tempo nas provas do que o tempo estipulado pela equipe de instrutores. Cheguei a pensar que estava fazendo tudo errado, mas vi nos fóruns que outros também tiveram a mesma dificuldade. Estou muito satisfeito, não quero provas mais fáceis, apenas uma noção mais adequada do tempo que será gasto (levando em conta que estrangeiros podem demorar mais para entender o enunciado).",Bruno L,2017-01-26,4,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python

"mal explicado, el profesor no explica los temas, solo los enuncia y tienes que buscar todo el material fuera de la plataforma, lo cual ocasiona que sea un curso muy complicado y que te tome muchísimo mas tiempo del que debería. Yo no siento que sea un curso, lo veo mas como una oportunidad para certificar si ya conoces todos los temas. Como consejo para los que quieren hacerlo, solamente lean las libretas y busquen los temas por internet, el profesor no les servirá de nada. dejo 1 estrella ( MUY MALO)",Jorge V,2020-08-03,1,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python
"Only 37 minutes of video, average per week. Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively — only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references.",Brian D,2017-02-27,3,python-data-analysis,Introduction to Data Science in Python
"Lectures are brief, shallow and too compressed
Grader is buggy
Generally course is bad. I spent more time in Stackoverflow than here to find answers

"The Capstone project is an interesting activity, but it is not a course. No new information is provided, it is a set of advanced excercises related to the previous database course.

"As an experienced programmer, I am disappointed.  The assignments cover a good set of tools; the capstone project.  Overall, the course is well structured; content switches between running a sample project and a student project.  Collaberation is encouraged.  Unfortunately, the example project is poorly written and buggy.  I finally lost confidence in the instructor when I saw circular programming in program gmodel.py between function ""fixsender"" and array ""mapping"".  The student selected project was entirely optional.  There are comments in the forums from students pointing out bugs; other comments stated that the course's exercises left commenters unable to perform the final, capstone project.  Overall, the presentation looks rushed and unpolished.  Example code looks like it was hobbled together until it worked and never edited for clarity.

"The specialization has been great so far until this last course.This course divides into two tracks: Normal and Honors.Normal just simply let you complete 20+ multiple choice quiz based on knowledge in the specialization. Then you earn a certificate.Honors track is what I disliked. Assignment lets you simply run the codes provided by the professor and get in peer-reviews. You just run it, that's all for the honors certificate. It makes sense to just run it because the professor's codes in this course were ways beyond our knowledge gained through the specialization. They were like 5 times longer and more complex. It took me days to figure out a few lines of codes but eventually you no need to understand any of it, just run it.The improvement for the course would be bringing the codes difficulty down and let us actually edit them for the assignments.",Maytat L,2020-04-22,2,python-data-visualization,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python"

"As with the third course in the specialization, the lectures give just enough to allow students to independently advance their learning outside the course. To be honest, I think the instructor covers too much ground in too short a time for most students to gain a lot of understanding. Furthermore, the assignments are quite straightforward requiring minimal adaptation of the supplied code.The module on Object Orientated Programming is, frankly, a waste to time and a distraction. There are no practical exercises and the material is run through at a pace that makes it unlikely that anyone without prior knowledge would make any sense of it. What is more, there is no reference to, or use of, OOP at any other point in the course or specialization. The time would have been better spent in expanding the modules on the core topics of using databases with Python.On the positive side, the external tools on Dr Chuck's own website seem to work as expected and integrate smoothly with Coursera. The forums also remain supportive, although, as with most courses, far less active than on the old platform.I still rate this as a 4 star (albeit a 4-) as Dr Chuck is such an engaging instructor and there is still a good progression through the specialization. I would be more cautious if taking this as a standalone course.",Paul J M,2016-03-14,4,python-databases,Using Databases with Python

"I have been programming in R for years, but I did learn some new things in this course!",John W,2017-01-22,5,r-programming,R Programming
"There is an incredibly wide gap between the lectures and the exercises presented on Swirl and the coding needed to pass the assignments. So much so that I didn't have to tools to approach the assignments with what I feel comfortable using. This is a huge detriment to the learning objectives of the course.At several points, I contemplated quitting because of this consideration. I imagine it is a huge hurdle. I have no coding experience, but I am traditionally a good student so this is frustrating. This is my first Coursera sequence, though I have taken online classes before through more traditional universities.",Manish A,2020-06-02,3,r-programming,R Programming

"Course has the appearance of being quickly thrown together. Assignments are impossible to complete due to random number generation mismatches. Lecture content frequently does not really help with the assignments, and a lot of the video information is extremely useless in real world applications.",Thomas A,2018-06-30,1,r-programming,R Programming
Doesn't teach many functions that are related to how to solve the question at hand,Thomas Y,2020-01-14,1,r-programming,R Programming
"Better than the Data Scientist's toolbox, but not a great introduction to R. When I'm learning a new language, I don't want to know about data types and for loops. A detailed example showing the strengths of this language would be better.  ",Andrew C,2016-09-21,2,r-programming,R Programming
Its a tough course. Need more help within the assignments.,Ravi M,2017-05-03,5,r-programming,R Programming
"A good class.  Some of the concepts required a good deal of research to understand and use, but that research is really the heart of modern development anyway.",Richard S,2016-02-09,4,r-programming,R Programming
"Great way to learn the fundamental building blocks of R. it is east to get stuff done by just copy pasting snippets of code from StackOverlfow, however this course gives you a good primer on R data types, variables and functions.",Ashish T,2017-10-30,5,r-programming,R Programming

This course does not teach thoroughly. There is no direction or lead in to best practices.,Shawn L,2016-04-12,3,r-programming,R Programming
"good, but the assignment difficulty is too great in weeks 2 and 4, requiring too much time for a working stiff to complete. There is too large a gap between the lecture/practice material and the assignments. This course may be better suited to folks without full time jobs, or who already can code. ",Martin B,2017-06-10,3,r-programming,R Programming
"The way of talking in the videos is erratic. It looks like he is always in doubt of what to say. His speech is full of ""eeer"" and non-completed words. I don't mean to be a fusspot, but when English is not your mother tongue, this is key to stay engaged. A script to read would probably solve most of these issues. He seems to have a great understanding of the topics he is explaining, however, not being able to communicate it properly results in a bit of a failure for me. I'll maybe try again in the future.",Antonio M,2017-12-12,2,r-programming,R Programming
"Nice Course, It really passed my expectations.",Luis C,2017-09-03,5,r-programming,R Programming

"This course is very good for beginners in R language and it is highly recommended for people looking to dive into the world of Data Analytics or Machine Learning. R is very powerful language and this course from one of the reputed universities of the world, John Hopkins is one of the best out there to learn from. The difficulty level of programming assignments is increased gradually to challenge the programmer inside you. Overall a highly recommended course for beginners. ",Shamsher S,2020-01-06,5,r-programming,R Programming
Excellent and challenging introduction to programming in R. Plenty of materials to help you along the way and the course is delivered at a reasonable pace in a friendly and clear manner.

"I've learned great things during this course, I feel powerful now! Yet be aware that the first two practical assignments are very difficult.",Vivien P,2017-05-30,4,r-programming,R Programming
"Was tough enough to give me the feel of solving real problems. Would have appreciated a little more explanation of the return types of the looping functions, all time was spent on the parameters and no time on what the data structure returned is. Online documentation is also weak on this point so some instruction would have been helpful. ",Chris C,2016-06-23,5,r-programming,R Programming
"So the course is a mixed bag.  PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry. I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coding. However, they could have shown more real-time coding, rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the Command Window pasted. You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures. The quizzes are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.CONS: The assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures. The quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly. There's no intermediate material to test your skill. You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments. ",Daniel F,2016-09-03,3,r-programming,R Programming

A little too much for a beginner especially the assignments. had to use functions not thought in the course. need to create a course that is veered for total beginners. Most classes are good but some classes were too difficult to understand and the lecturer would just flyby and it got very complicated .,Henloy A,2018-04-20,4,r-programming,R Programming
"Overall, a somewhat challenging course due to the complexity of assignments not matching the lectures.  The lectures were simplistic, which would be acceptable for this course level, but applying this information to the assignments went well beyond what the instruction given.  I would not expect the assignments to be a recitation based on the lectures and expect their difficulty to increase.  However, I spent a considerable amount of self-learning to complete the assignments.  I would have spent more time, if it weren't for a couple of contributors/mentors on the discussion forums helping us along.",Paul M,2018-04-22,3,r-programming,R Programming

"Not meant for a complete beginner.  I've spoken to a dozen people who have taken this course, and if you don't have some programming skills, you'll struggle.

The lessons and exercises gave me enough information to know what I was trying to accomplish and where to find the answers, without spoon feeding me solutions.

"Don't get me wrong. The course is a nice broad introduction. Rebekah May has a lovely way of teaching. However, the first ""two weeks"" are more of an HR commercial, advertising the SEO career than actually teaching relevant topics. Also ""week two"" with the co-professor is more than unnecessary and can be left out completely. The rest is (though it is very basic and starts from the very beginning) nicely explained and interesting. I am looking forward to watching the deeper modules and will continue to give this a chance!",Maximilian P,2020-05-18,3,search-engine-optimization,Introduction to Search Engine Optimization

"There are 3 major issues with this course: 1. the instructor appears to be reading from a teleprompter and constantly struggles with her text, making the lectures both distracting and soporific. The cheerleading ('Are you excited about joins yet?') doesn't do anything to change that. 2. Some portions of the final assignments are poorly worded and the mentors aren't active. 3. There is a huge backlog for assignment grading which is frustrating and causes the discussion threads to be polluted by students asking for others to grade their assignment.

"I'm fairly proficient in R and wanted to add a database language to my data science repertoire. Most data science jobs ask for SQL so I thought this was the perfect starting point for learning. I found learning the language fairly straightforward, especially because many SQL-type commands are built into R packages (like dplyr). My job has a comprehensive relational database but, I usually use a point and click interface to make queries- now that I'm more proficient I'll start using SQL though. Additionally, I was hoping to pick up SQL before starting my grad program in analytics so I can ""hit the ground running"" and be ready for classes focused on database management and data engineering. I was able to accomplish this without any question.I really liked the course, which is not surprising given all of Coursera's data science content is excellent. The final assignment was very thorough and helped put together lots of focused questions you might encounter using SQL as a data scientist. It really helped solidify my learning. For about $60, this was a no brainer for getting started in the language.",Mark P,2018-01-03,5,sql-for-data-science,SQL for Data Science

It has things not explained in the course that were not easy to solve.  Of course, after figuring out the answer, it seems easy, but it is not while the person does not get it.But overall, I loved it.

"Good course to learn a overall high-level view of SQL. However, to get the full grasp of SQL you need to practice SQL from external resources as well. This course explains SQL commands in a brief and concise way. ",Anand N,2019-03-30,5,sql-for-data-science,SQL for Data Science
"Most of the course is satisfactory. However, the final project has some major problems. First, it will take you longer than the stated 2 hours. Also, documentation on the provided data is lacking. Moreover, a large part of the final project is data analysis that you would never conduct in SQL - what would take a few lines of code in Python becomes cumbersome and frustrating and incomplete in SQL. If you're interested in obtaining the course certificate, just be aware that you won't encounter the most frustrating part of the course until you've completed every other course requirement.

The course is amazing at introducing IT systems administration. It allows newcomers to learn more about the general job as a SysAdmin. The courses sadly isn't too detailed but is enough to give you the general overview. The labs are enough to make me understand but it might not be challenging enough for some people.,Ezra I S W,2019-08-11,4,system-administration-it-infrastructure-services,System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services
"This course was difficult for me to get through, mostly because of the dense material. However, by the end of the course, my peer reviewer reflected on how I was clearly an active professional in the industry...and I am actually a stay at home mom with no prior IT work experience. I worked in the film and theater industry before. So my recommendation would be, no matter how much of a slog this course is to get through, you will definitely walk away with a firm grasp of the concepts and language you will face in a real work environment.

"This course is very great at teaching you the fundamentals of IT. If you do want to learn the topics in depth and do some personal research after every video or reading, that will take more than the suggested 5 hours a week. I spent roughly 15 hours per week on this course, but I grasped the information very well, I took notes and did personal research after very video. This course moves quite fast, but it surely teaches things very well, and is to the point.

"This course is an excellent, 10-week road to a better understanding of the many actions we can take to make ourselves happier. It is taught in a straighforward, honest language with a nurturing tone that is relatable and doesn't talk down to the students. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in exploring their own happiness and how it fits into the society in which we live today. I have always (naively) thought that in a life where you put happiness as your top priority, you will find the most fulfillment. It turns out, I wasn't wrong, I just wasn't able to fully see my happiness as it fits into a bigger picture when it comes to socialization, relationships, wellness, mindset, time management, and my own selfish needs and wants.

And although this course is mostly about quantifying many of the intangibles behind marketing, the professor proves himself a sympathetic and warm teacher of bloodless mathematics.  My only criticism concerns some ambiguity around terms: for example the term ""log"" may refer to 'log base 10' or natural log, base 'e' and this was not clear for me in the presentation.

"Quiz questions are filled with misspelled words, incorrect & thus confusing grammar, additional random words or letters that add to the confusion. Also, questions are vague and answers are specific and visa-versa. This makes the corse not about learning or testing one's knowledge, but instead about guessing what the question writer was thinking at the moment they wrote the question. If the material was presented with clearer communication, the quiz questions and answers used correct grammar, spelling and appropriate parallelism, this course would be educational. Until those changes are made, this course fails to be educational to those of us who are not clairvoyant.",David S,2020-05-20,1,uva-darden-market-analytics,Marketing Analytics

We all know that accounting is boring and many of us are struggling to get even the basics. However, if you stay tuned throughout the course you will see that the professor is doing exceptional work while introducing Cash Flow Statement (which is the most challenging part of financial accounting to many newbeies).

"Professor Brian Bushee is a wonderful teacher. He makes Financial Accounting interesting by illustrating how it can be practically applied in real life scenarios. There are many examples so that you don't have to conceptualize everything and the material is more comprehensible. He makes it entertaining by introducing virtual students that ask him questions that real students would ask and a few that i hadn't thought to ask but provide beneficial information.There is a lot of material. It is quite complex. Financial Accounting is a mix of rules, intuition, terms that must be learned, very particular processes, and last but not least, some math. This isn't for the faint of heart. That said, I found it interesting and learned more than I had planned on. I may take the follow up course as well. I can't imagine learning this material from a typical instructor. I wouldn't enjoy it and i wouldn't be able to take as much from it. Superior course. Apologies for any typos.",William H,2016-08-12,5,wharton-accounting,Introduction to Financial Accounting

"A lot of useful information valuable for negotiation of almost any type of service or product marketing I can think of. At first, I didn't like so much the format, but then, the capacity of the lecturer to síntesis is astonishing and greatly outscored the standard presentations.

"I really loved this class. There is no magic formula to make a product goes viral, but there is a behavioural science behind that, and it answers to social
dynamics. Jonah Berger makes very nice examples to explain viral marketing and to make simple ideas stick into your mind. Easy to follow, class finished in 1 day.",Ivan F,2020-04-02,5,wharton-contagious-viral-marketing,Viral Marketing and How to Craft Contagious Content

Generally a nice push into the right direction. Makes you think and makes sense - Although very broad. For a course with a certification not representative at all.

"A very interesting module emphasizing the importance of meaningful data, how to use it for predictive and prescriptive customer analytics. The insights into customer behaviour and how marketing has evolved to the present form of the all-encompassing digital marketing and how to use it for customer analytics has been very revealing. A combination of online and offline marketing is the way to go in future. I can look back in retrospect and just wonder at the number of customers with Indian banks who would not pass muster on any predictive model. While analytics was still at a nascent stage in Indian banks when I retired, I still feel that even where predictive models are used, there is hardly any follow-up action. I saw the hallowed halls of Wharton for the first time and really hope to see them in person at least once. ",ARVIND K S,2018-05-08,5,wharton-customer-analytics,Customer Analytics

"Highly recommended. Delivered by leading faculty for the Wharton school, we are first shown what exactly customer analytics is. The approach from the Wharton School is to look at each individual customer (or rather group customers according to their habits and demographics). We are shown the three types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive. The predictive week delves into regression analyses, but at a high level. Very interesting is the Buy Til You Die probability model, which seeks to model how past customer activities will translate into future lifetime value. We also look at profit maximisation (MR=MC), and conclude with some real world examples of applying these techniques for profit in the real world. Overall, an excellent primer.

There is an obvious lack of attention to detail - quizzes pop up in mid-sentence, tests include material that is not covered yet (or at all), and speakers refer to topics that other lecturers covered (which they didn't).

"I liked Professor Waterman; he is clear, gives examples, and doesn't just drone over the slides like my statistics professor did in college. However, the course itself felt a little too simplified. For example, when I arrived at the topic of multiple regression, concepts like collinearity and omitted variable bias, which are crucial to understand the fitness of your model, were not mentioned. This was a bit concerning because most business operations, I would assume, have multiple variables in play and would seem more practical to have a more in-depth focus on models reflecting that characteristic.",John C,2018-04-30,3,wharton-quantitative-modeling,Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling

enjoyed it. I appreciate the fact that you have included diverse set of 
students for interviews. Going forward, it would be great if you could identify a female co-instructor
 to add more diversity and different perspective to the structure and 
presentation of the materials. I believe that having a woman as 
instructor (not only voice over) would make the whole topic more 
accessible for women participants.Could you share some statistics on the proportion of women among students who enrolled for the course and graduated?Thanks a lot.",Daniela R,2020-04-15,5,what-is-datascience,What is Data Science?

"A complete waste of anyone's time who knows anything about data science and would seek the data science specialization on this site.  Further, the course material thus far appears to be a paid-for repackaging of free instructional materials offered by IBM at bigdatauniversity.com.  Why I had to sit through this material is beyond me in the context of a data science skills tract. Please, stop wasting professionals' precious time and money with this material.  This material took me merely a weekend to get through, not 3 weeks, the framing of which seems questionable at best.  Please remove this from the overall specialization.

"I enrolled in the IBM Data Science specialization and this is the first course. It says no experience necessary and I was skeptical but went ahead and signed up with--you guessed it-- no experience whatsoever! Starting with almost no knowledge on the subject, I learned a lot. Other reviews suggest that this was too basic for many people. Perhaps there could be a way to test out of it for the specialization? I was happy to find that the work was easily doable over the course of several days. The main thing I would change would be the inconsistencies. I got a wrong answer on a quiz which was then a correct answer on the final assignment. Doing peer reviews of others' answers, I found almost everyone answered the same thing incorrectly, not surprising since the reading on that topic had different information than the answer key with which we were asked to grade.",Miranda C,2020-04-10,4,what-is-datascience,What is Data Science?
